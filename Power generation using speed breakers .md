# Power generation using speed breakers 
## Error Analysis:
### FRL Unit:
Modern FRLs have electronic or warning light indicators to raise a maintenance alert. <br />
Older systems can still be monitored by checking the condition of filter and lubricator bowls for accumulated water and a steady oil supply.<br />
Correct selection, sizing and maintenance of FRL components will save money over time, as machines function more efficiently and for longer, experiencing fewer leaks .<br />
### Impeller:
The overspeed machine is used for testing which can be outfitted with various mandrels (fixtures or shafts that retain impellers when mounted on the spindle of an overspeed machine) to accommodate different sizes of impellers and speeds. The machine continually measures vacuum pressure, speed, and vibration during the test. The latter is measured with a proximity probe.
### Alternator Testing :
To determine what components has caused the problem, you will be required to disassemble and test the alternator.
### Rotor Testing :
To test the rotor for grounds, shorts, and opens:<br />
To check for grounds, connect a test lamp or ohmmeter from one of the slip rings to the rotor shaft .A low ohmmeter reading or the lighting of the test lamp indicates that the rotor winding is grounded.<br />

To check the rotor for shorts and opens, connect the ohmmeter to both slip rings . 
An ohmmeter reading below the manufacturer's specified resistance value indicates a short. A reading above the specified resistance value indicates an open. If a test lamp does not light when connected to both slip rings, the winding is open.

### Stator Testing:
The stator winding can be tested for opens and grounds after it has been disconnected from the alternator end frame. <br />
If the ohmmeter reading is low or the test lamp lights when connected between each pair of stator leads the stator winding is electrically good. <br />
A high ohmmeter reading or failure of the test lamp to light when connected from any one of the leads to
